# Bugo Data Shell
Spring boot module used to interact with data coming from IoT and requested/used from Flutter app

## Design choices

### Device and User
In BugoDataShell, user is tied to a device so that he can track all the devices sensors and info. For this reason,
all the following design choices have been selected:
- A Device does not contain user info. A device can self register itself and it is independent of users.
- When we register a User, we need to provide Device identifier. This is because a user is
  registering to a device in order to track its info
- A user can be registered to only one device
  - This can be changed in future, but for now we want a user to be linked to only one device. A device can be used by many users
- When we ask info about users, we also retrieve the device info
- When updating a user, we cannot update the device he's linked to (if other users are registered to the same device,
  they would receive unwanted modifications)

## Using Docker to deploy
The steps to run the application in docker are the following:

### Ensure you have a working Docker instance
Ensure that Docker Desktop or similar are active.

### Ensure you have a docker builder for multiplatforms
If you don't have it, run the following command:
```
docker buildx create --name my-multiplatform-builder --driver docker-container --use
docker buildx inspect my-multiplatform-builder --bootstrap
```

### Ensure you have a docker network already up
If you don't have it, run the following command:
```
docker network create boogle-network
```

### Create local docker images
To create the docker images of the db and the application, go on the root of the project and run:
```
mvn clean install -Plocal-image
```

If you only want to create only the db image, run the previous command from packager-db sumbodule instead of root.

If you only want to create only the application image, run the previous command from packager sumbodule instead of root.

### Run db docker container

To run a docker db container, run the following command and populate the db variables as you need:

```
docker run --name boogle-bugo-data-shell-db --network=boogle-network -e POSTGRES_DB=dbBds -e POSTGRES_USER=dbBds -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbBds -v C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-db-liquibase.properties:/config/liquibase.properties -dp 127.0.0.1:5434:5432 pyrosandro/boogle-bugo-data-shell-db-image:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

Command explanation:
1. **docker run:** This is the command to run a Docker container.
2. **--name boogle-bugo-data-shell-db:** This option specifies the name of the container as "boogle-bugo-data-shell-db". The --name flag allows you to assign a custom name to the container instead of Docker generating a random one.
3. **--network=boogle-network:** This option specifies the network to which the container should be attached. It connects the container to the "boogle-network" Docker network.
4. **-e POSTGRES_DB=dbBds:** This option sets the environment variable POSTGRES_DB inside the container to "dbBds". This variable is used to specify the name of the PostgreSQL database to be created inside the container.
5. **-e POSTGRES_USER=dbBds:** This option sets the environment variable POSTGRES_USER inside the container to "dbBds". This variable is used to specify the username for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
6. **-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbBds:** This option sets the environment variable POSTGRES_PASSWORD inside the container to "dbBds". This variable is used to specify the password for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
7. **-v C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-db-liquibase.properties:/config/liquibase.properties:** This mounts a file from the host machine (C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-db-liquibase.properties) to the container's file system (/config/liquibase.properties). This is useful for configuration files that need to be accessible to the application running in the container.
8. **-dp 127.0.0.1:5434:5432:** This option specifies the port mapping for the container. It maps port 5432 on the container to port 5434 on the host machine (127.0.0.1). The -d flag tells Docker to run the container in detached mode (in the background), and the -p flag specifies the port mapping.
9. **pyrosandro/boogle-bugo-data-shell-db-image:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:** This is the name of the Docker image to use for creating the container. It specifies the image "pyrosandro/boogle-bugo-data-shell-db-image" with the tag "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT".

### Run app docker container

To run a docker app container, run the following command and populate the variables as needed.

```
docker run --name boogle-bugo-data-shell --network=boogle-network -e "SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONAL_LOCATION=/config/external-props.yml" -v C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-external-props.yml:/config/external-props.yml -dp 127.0.0.1:8082:8082 pyrosandro/boogle-bugo-data-shell-image:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

Command explanation:
1. **docker run:** This is the command used to run a Docker container.
2. **--name boogle-bugo-data-shell:** This option sets the name of the container to "boogle-bugo-data-shell". The --name flag allows you to assign a custom name to the container instead of Docker generating a random one.
3. **--network=boogle-network:** This option specifies the network to which the container should be attached. It connects the container to the Docker network named "boogle-network".
4. **-e "SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONAL_LOCATION=/config/external-props.yml":** This option sets an environment variable within the container. It defines an additional location for Spring configuration properties (external-props.yml). This environment variable allows the application inside the container to load configuration from an external file.
5. **-v C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-external-props.yml:/config/external-props.yml:** This option mounts a volume from the host machine to the container. It maps the local file external-props.yml located on the host machine's desktop (C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-external-props.yml) to the container's /config/external-props.yml path. This volume mounting allows the containerized application to access configuration files from the host machine.
6. **-dp 127.0.0.1:8082:8082:** This option specifies the port mapping for the container. It maps port 8082 on the container to port 8082 on the host machine (127.0.0.1). The -d flag runs the container in detached mode (in the background), and the -p flag specifies the port mapping.
7. **pyrosandro/boogle-bugo-data-shell-image:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:** This part of the command specifies the Docker image to use for creating the container. It specifies the image "pyrosandro/boogle-bugo-data-shell-image" with the tag "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT".

Note: The external-props.yml file should contain the values of the variables needed in application.yml file. For an example, you can see the file application-localdev.yml

## Deploy artifacts and docker images

### Deploy artifacts on github packages
To deploy artifacts on github packages, ensure that in pom.xml you have set up the distribution management that allows you to specify to which repo you will push your artifact
```
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>my-github-repos</id>
        <name>GitHub alessandrogranato bugo-data-shell repo</name>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/alessandrogranato/bugo-data-shell</url>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

To deploy the artifacts, simply run the following command:

```
mvn clean deploy
```

### Deploy artifacts and docker images all at once
To deploy application and db docker images, go on parent pom folder and launch the following command:
```
mvn clean deploy -Pbuild-and-deploy-docker-image
```

-----------------------------------------

## Post installation operations

### Dev environment - Install liquibase scripts

Once the db is installed, you can run your liquibase scripts by going into the project liquibase folder and run the following command:

```
mvn install -Pliquibase
```

Note: if you need to rollback your scripts, run the following command (in the example, we rollback the last 2 scripts from master.xml):

```
mvn clean -Pliquibase -Dliquibase.rollbackCount=2
```

### Prod environment - Copy and run liquibase scripts

In prod environment you don't have the bugo-data-shell project, but you have the container. If you need to add or remove scripts, you can manually copy the master.xml file and the sql folder inside the container, then run the liquibase command to update or rollback. In order to do so, you can do the following:
**Note:** We assume your sql folder and master.xml file have been already copied from this project into the host folder: C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-db-liquibase\sql

```
docker cp C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-db-liquibase\sql boogle-bugo-data-shell-db:/config
docker cp C:\Users\PyroSandro\Desktop\PublicRepos\boogle\boogle-extra\bugo-data-shell-db-liquibase\master.xml boogle-bugo-data-shell-db:/config/master.xml
```

If you want to add scripts, run the following command:
```
docker exec boogle-bugo-data-shell-db bash -c "cd /config && liquibase --changelog-file=master.xml update"
```

If you want to rollback scripts (in the example only the last), run the following command:
```
docker exec boogle-bugo-data-shell-db bash -c "cd /config && liquibase --changelog-file=master.xml rollbackCount 1"
```
