    In table Users we could do the following changes:
        add id, which would be long and autogenerated
        change user_identifier into string
        users_devices table will now take Users::id instead of user_id as constraint reference
    To retrieve user_identifier, we would need to introduce it also in Auth (easy, fast) or in a subsequent module Users (easy, long to do)
